# CircleGame

This game began as an extra credit assignment for my Java Applications course. My professor created a game application with almost no functionality and intentional poor design. He asked us to use the principles of design and developement we had learned to improve the game in both functionality and design. Check out the documents folder to see the original application file created by my professor.

Game Play: You are the cyan (greenish-blue) sprite. Your goal is to level up and gain as many points as possible along the way. Points are gained by consuming friendly sprites. Points are lost by colliding with enemy sprites. To move up to the next level you must consume a green sprite. Here's a breakdown of the different sprites by color:

Green - consume this sprite and you level up. The green sprite also offers the greatest amount of points.

Blue - consume this sprite and you get bigger and gain points. But be careful, getting bigger makes you an easy target for enemies!

Grey - consume this sprite and you go faster and gain points. Speed is most important.

Red - collide with this sprite and your size decreases and you lose points.

Orange - collide with this sprite and you lose speed and points. You don't want to lose speed!

Black - don't worry about colliding with this sprite, it can't hurt you. But it will fire deadly projectiles at your sprite that will instantly kill it.
